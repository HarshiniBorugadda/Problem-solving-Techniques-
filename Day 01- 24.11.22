Q: How to find the sum of the elements in the array?
a) Use a for loop (T(n)=O(n))
b) In case of doing it multiple times for multiple arrays or something like that use in-built function specific to the language or create a function and use it.
Q: How to tackle pattern related questions?
A: Basically patterns contains rows and cols and some symbols, characters or numbers etc..
a) First thing to be focused upon is take two or three examples atleast and try to infer a common logic from them.
b) Use for loops and try to implement the logic that you've inferred. 


Basic Note for everyone--
We know that mistakes happen quite a lot of time but be patient at that time don't feel like you're a loser and you're not fit for coding etc...
It happens that most of the times we tend to feel that way. But, still it's okay that's the process.
Things take time to learn but remember one thing DON'T GIVE UP.
Learn a little by little and try to enjoy the process:)
